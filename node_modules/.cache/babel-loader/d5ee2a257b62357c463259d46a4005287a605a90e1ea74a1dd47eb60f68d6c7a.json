Throughout my journey, I encountered remarkable individuals who left a lasting impression on me. Dirtsa, the secretary, welcomed me warmly, and receiving the keys to my workspace felt like a significant ritual. I also had the pleasure of meeting colleagues from various labs who understood and empathized with the challenges I faced. Their support and camaraderie left an indelible mark on my soul.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"I was a youthful 26-year-old, fortunate enough to receive an Erasmus scholarship that allowed me to travel and study in different countries. From Taiwan and Hong Kong to Leuven and beyond, I embraced the opportunity to expand my horizons. By the age of 24, I had resided in six countries and worked as an interpreter on the side. My educational background was in theoretical physics, and despite receiving six enticing offers, I pursued a Ph.D. in the beautiful city of Lesab, Lnadreztiws\\u2014a long-cherished dream come true.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"Early on, during my interview at Lesab, I noticed that the Professor conversed with her other Ph.D. students in Italian. Curiosity led me to request conversations with Ph.D. students about their experiences, expecting those discussions to take place in English, considering my presence as a non-Italian speaker within an academic setting. Unfortunately, my assumption was incorrect. Emails and meetings were primarily conducted in Italian between the Professor and the Italian students before being relayed to the non-Italians. This unequal treatment made me profoundly uncomfortable, as I believed that all Ph.D. students should be treated equally. I voiced my concerns directly to the professor, hoping for change. Her response, \\\"It is easier for me to communicate in Italian,\\\" left me disheartened. Nevertheless, I discovered that I was not the first to raise such concerns, indicating a systemic issue.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\" \",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"A dear friend from my school days was on the verge of relocating to Google's Zurich branch. However, on hearing my experiences in the workplace, he promptly reconsidered and opted to remain in New York. \\\"If your professor were at Google, she would have been dismissed numerous times.

They sought guidance on navigating the gender inequality prevalent in our predominantly male-dominated field. The normalization of such unsettling experiences shook me to the core. It felt inconceivable that such matters were casually discussed among friends, as if it were an ordinary aspect of our lives.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\" \",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"I decided to seek assistance from the central HR department, hoping for a resolution to the racial discrimination and harassment issues that plagued my time at the university. However, by this point, I was completely burnt out.

I chose not to pursue legal action because, as a 30-something aspiring tenure-track professor without a permanent position and with the added burden of being pregnant, I knew that engaging in a lengthy legal battle would drain what little physical and emotional strength I had left. In the group I was part of, the quickest way to resolve a problem was often to eliminate the person who raised it.
